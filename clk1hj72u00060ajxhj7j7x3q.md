**Introduction:** In the world of programming, game development serves as a fantastic way to apply your coding skills and create something enjoyable for users. In this blog post, we will dive into the details of a recent project called "Guess My Number." This game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offers an engaging experience for players to guess a random number generated by the computer. Let's explore the mechanics and development process behind this exciting project!

**Game Objective:** The objective of "Guess My Number" is straightforward: guess the randomly generated number chosen by the computer. The number will be within the range of 1 to 20. With every guess, the player will receive feedback on whether their guess is too high, or too low, or if they have guessed the correct number the player wins.

**Development Process:** To create this game, we utilized the popular web development technologies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a breakdown of the different components involved in building this project:

**HTML:** The HTML part of the project forms the basic structure of the game. It consists of a heading to display the game title and a section to display the user's current guess and the feedback from the computer. Additionally, an input field and a submit button are included to enable the player to enter their guesses.

**CSS:** CSS styling is crucial to enhance the game's visual appeal. By utilizing CSS, we can design an engaging user interface with an attractive layout, appealing colors, and eye-catching fonts.

**JavaScript:** The game logic is implemented using JavaScript. This language provides the necessary tools to generate a random number, compare it with the user's guess, and provide appropriate feedback. The core functionality revolves around conditional statements that check if the guess is too high, too low, or correct. JavaScript ensures a smooth interaction between the user and the game.

Game Flow: Let's walk through the step-by-step flow of the game:

1. The player launches the game and is presented with a screen displaying the game's title and the user has to input a Number.
    
2. The computer generates a random number between 1 and 20, which remains hidden from the player.
    
3. The player enters their guess into the input field provided and clicks the click button.
    
4. JavaScript compares the user's guess with the computer's generated number.
    
5. If the user's guess is too high, the game displays the message "Too high!" to indicate that the actual number is lower.
    
6. If the user's guess is too low, the message "Too low!" is displayed to indicate that the actual number is higher.
    
7. If the user's guess matches the computer's generated number, the game congratulates the player and displays the message "You won!"
    
8. The player can then choose to play again, by clicking the AGAIN button in the game for another round of guessing.
