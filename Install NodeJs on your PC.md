**Step 6: Executing Your First Code**: To execute your first Node.js code, create a new file named `hello.js` and open it in a text editor. Add the following code:

To execute your first Node.js code, create a new file named `hello.js` and open it in a text editor. Add the following code:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, Node.js!");
```

Save the file and navigate to the folder where the `hello.js` file is located using the command prompt or terminal.

To run the code, enter the following command:

```javascript
node hello.js
```

You should see the output `Hello, Node.js!` printed in the command prompt or terminal.

Or, you can also download VS-code and start executing the code.

Conclusion: Congratulations! You have successfully installed Node.js and executed your first code. Node.js opens up a world of possibilities for building powerful web applications with JavaScript.

Now that you have Node.js up and running, you can explore its vast ecosystem and begin building amazing applications.

Happy coding with Node.js!
